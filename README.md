# RTL_30_Day_Streak
Latches:
->Latches are level triggered. /*O/P depends on level of i/p signal rather than Transition of signal*/
->Operation depends on the enable signal and clock signal is not needed.
->It is faster and simpler.
->Consumes less power.
->It is used in Asynchronous circuits.

Flip-Flops:
->Flip-Flops are edge triggered. /* o/p changes when there is a Transition in i/p signal*/
->Operation depends on clock signal.
->It is slower and complex.
->Consumes more power.
->It is used in Synchronous circuits.
